Bloom is a cycle-tracking and reflection app designed to help women understand their menstrual cycles in a holistic, compassionate way. Instead of focusing only on dates and symptoms, Bloom connects cycle phases with emotions, energy, habits, and personal reflection.

The app allows users to track periods, log daily check-ins (including mood, energy, symptoms, and notes), and receive gentle insights over time. Bloom encourages reflection-first habit tracking, guided journaling, and visual growth through calming metaphors like the Bloom Garden.

Bloom is built with emotional safety, privacy, and user control at its core. Language is supportive and non-clinical, data is owned by the user, and features like reminders and insights are designed to support—not pressure—daily awareness. The goal of Bloom is to help users feel more connected to their bodies, patterns, and growth over time.
